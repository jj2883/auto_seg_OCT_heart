# auto_seg_OCT_heart
Auto-segmentation of Endocardium and Myocardium of OCT image of Heart to generate Dataset for DL.

Utilizes image processing to produce training/test datasaet for deep learning

Uses BM-3D to denoise the input image and energy minimizing method to find the boundary between endocardium and myocardium
